# Traffic Relay Node Placement Dataset

Welcome to the Traffic Relay Node Placement Dataset repository! This dataset has been curated for research and analysis in the field of traffic engineering and focuses on the placement of relay nodes. It contains two main sets of data: the sensor node set and the relay node set. Each node set includes the corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates, which are crucial for evaluating the performance of traffic networks and determining optimal relay node placements.

## Description
**The dataset is derived from real traffic scenes**: The data in this dataset has been collected from actual traffic scenarios, ensuring its authenticity and representing real-world traffic conditions. By using data from real traffic scenes, this dataset aims to provide valuable insights for traffic engineering research and practical applications.

## Usage
